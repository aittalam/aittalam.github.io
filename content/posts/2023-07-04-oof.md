   Oof
   July 4th, 2022
  ----------------------------------------


  I am feeling a bit tired today. Well, tonight, considering I am writing
  from my bed, on my phone, at midnight. L is sleeping next to me and her
  breathing is soothing, it is exactly what I need now and at the same
  time what I will miss tomorrow.
  
  I will fly again tomorrow, and I lost count of how many flights I took
  since the beginning of this year. All of them well worth the effort, as
  they were made either to spend time with my kids or come back to L, but
  today was one of those days where my body literally stopped working.
  After a day trip with both L and the kids (the very last of 10 days they
  spent here in London), I crashed on my couch and... turned off. I woke 
  up 90 minutes later, and now of course I am having a harder time falling
  asleep.

  7 PM: I fell asleep :-) and the rest of the day went on incredibly
  quickly, between the preparation for the trip and (part of) the trip
  itself. We are now in LTN waiting for our delayed plane to land here
  from Italy... and if we are lucky we might be able to be home before
  1AM. Oof! Luckily the kids are great, I have found a few things to do
  together (scavenge for food and water fountains, find a quiet spot to
  seat, have dinner, and watch a movie) and now they are taking a break
  from the movie allowing me to write from my iPad.
  
  iPad, phone, laptop - this is how I update my phlog: I just ssh to my
  gopher server and reattach my screen tab to resume my work (like I just
  did from my phone, 'cause the kids asked me to give them the iPad 
  again!), I edit my posts with vim, then commit push my changes to git to
  back them up and sync them on my laptop if I want to work offline. Yeah,
  still not a super-barebones setup but I find it light enough to allow me
  to focus on contents, rather than anything else.
  
  Speaking about contents, I have been reading a few phlogs lately which
  captivated me. What they have in common is that they are more personal 
  than technical, and regardless of the particular topic I found all of
  them more profound and interesting than many others. But the plane is
  about to leave, and I will talk about them more profusely next time :-)
