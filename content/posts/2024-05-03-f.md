  Among the photos in this forgotten webpage, one shows a young
  man holding a child in his arms. The caption says "Venice, 
  Sommer 1988". Only a handful of people in the whole world 
  know there are two mistakes in that caption, and that they 
  have been made on purpose.
  
  This is the story behind that photo.
  
  
                               ~
  
  
  The first mistake is, quite obviously, "Sommer": what most
  do not know is that it was intentionally written with the 
  German spelling into an English page to mislead readers 
  about the author's mother tongue. 
  
  Why?
  
  The best answer to this question can be found in another 
  page from the same website (http://searchlores.eu/io13.htm):
  
  
    "For the older reversers are less interested in themselves 
     than the younger ones, and better at getting inside other
     things. They are steadier, and keep their minds on things 
     longer"
  
  
  A quarter of a century before people started becoming the very
  content they wanted to share online, this person chose to hide
  his identity and disappear behind the message he was sharing. 
  And a long time before GDPR, when data privacy was not 
  everyone's problem yet, bullshitting your readers was quite an
  effective way to protect your own identity.
  
  But back to the mistakes in the caption, the second one is way
  less apparent: it is the photo's date.

  Summer 1998 - Lido, Venice
  
  A pair of Dr Martens tied together by their shoelaces was 
  hanging around the boy's neck. Taking them off and bringing
  sunglasses were his only wise choices that day: the sun was 
  scorching hot and he was walking on the beach, wearing a pair
  of black cargo shorts and a gray t-shirt, carrying a laptop 
  bag on his shoulders and, well, those freakin' Dr Martens. 
  
  The boy was looking for a man, with no idea whatsoever of how
  he should have looked like. "Come to the beach," the man said
  during the phone call they had the day before. "We are a 
  family of five, close to the shore. You'll find us. You are a
  reverser, after all." 
  
  That was the first time the boy had been called that way by 
  anyone. Well, that was also the first time the two of them had
  talked at all! Until then they had only communicated via email,
  and even that was done going through anonymous remailers. The 
  chance to meet the person behind the nickname was a privilege 
  he had earned after finding his real identity, and that was why
  the day after the call he had rushed onto a train -and then a
  vaporetto- to meet his mentor.


                               ~
  

  The title the boy had been called with was often used by the
  man, together with many others. Terms that, albeit different
  at a first glance, shared all the same deep meaning and aura
  of respect.
  
  Richard Stallman had coined the term "cracker" to reclaim the
  word hacker from association with security breaking
  (https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html). As a student
  of +ORC (the Old Red Cracker), the man had not just named
  himself as such. Using cracking as a way to reach a higher
  level of knowledge, he had given a new meaning to Leonard 
  Cohen's words: "There is a crack, a crack in everything, 
  that's how the light gets in".
  
  Later that day, on a vaporetto towards Cannaregio, the man 
  would have told the boy: "We are like vampires, infecting other
  people with knowledge and a different way of thinking about the
  world". And the boy, whose avatar in BBS systems was indeed a 
  vampire, would have understood that he was not the only who had
  learned about the other's identity.
  
  "Do you know where the restroom is?" - somebody would have
  asked him a few months later, from the other side of a table
  at A La Morte Subite, knowing he was a regular there.
  "You are a reverser, I am sure you can figure it out!" - he 
  would have replied.
  
  Years later, describing enthusiastically his new project while
  walking out of Ravensbourne College, the man would have called
  himself a searcher, saying he would have devoted his time to
  teaching people how to find everything on the Web.
  
  
                               ~
  
  
  A cracker, a vampire, a reverser, a searcher. Someone the boy
  was still looking for while walking under the sun. A whole he
  still only knew a tiny part of.

  The boy cannot believe what he is reading. He writes an email
  to the man, asking how he feels, what is going to happen now.
  
  The reply arrives soon. The last paragraph reads as follows:
  
  "But whenever possible, it is better to leave the pale screens
  and go outside: let us savor twilights while walking with our
  partners through our towns' historic centers, let ourselves be 
  caressed by the wind and the sun on the beaches, let us search
  for shells with our children. There are some beautiful ones."

  A cracker, a vampire, a reverser, a searcher.
  A partner, a father. 
  
  A family of five. The boy was looking for them, the Dr Martens
  hurting his neck.

  3 April 2023 - London
  
  Another year has passed. The boy realizes he is now older than
  the man when they first met. He has been a cracker, a vampire,
  a reverser, a searcher. He has become a partner, a father.
  
  He has pursued knowledge all this time. He has infected a few
  people. When on the beach he still looks for beautiful shells 
  (and does not bring Dr Martens).
  
  For many years, on this date, he has remembered him.
  
  For many years, on this date, he has missed his friend.
  
  
                               ~
  
  
  A cracker, a vampire, a reverser, a searcher.
  A partner, a father. 
  A friend.
  
  
  The boy turned his head. A man was looking in his direction,
  next to him a woman with a child in her arms, and two more
  kids playing with the sand. The man started laughing while he
  was approaching him.
  
  "Malattia?" -he shook his hand- "Nice to meet you! I am Fravia".

    "Un abbraccio, non c'è ragione di preoccuparsi: se è scritto 
     è scritto, e senno' ci faremo una gran cena insieme.
