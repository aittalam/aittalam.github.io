      ----------------------------------------
       Healed?
       January 22 - February 25 2023
      ----------------------------------------
       Written in a 1-month interval, just in
       case you wanted a quick answer to the
       title's question
      ----------------------------------------


I started this rant many times during the last month and then
scrapped it each time, willing to be able to say I had turned
page but never feeling like I could honestly do that.

I mean, things happened and most of them were great: the end
of the redundancy consultation, being freed from Twitter 2.0,
and finding a new job among others. And perhaps this makes it
harder for me to answer "meh" to my own question, because I
know I am privileged and lucky (and a little bit good too,
let us not be too modest about it), and I feel bad not being
content with this.

Then I realised I do not owe a definitive answer to anyone,
especially myself. I ended my previous post with

 I have to be more patient and give it the time it needs

I will write it again, with no copy/paste, to make it mine 
again:

 I have to be more patient and give it the time it needs
