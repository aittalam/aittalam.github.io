       Easter
       April 8, 2023
      ----------------------------------------
       Written in the mountains, on an iPad,
       SSHing to my server
      ----------------------------------------

  Here in the mountains towering over the lake of Garda,
  temperature is still quite low (which is why I am writing
  next to a stove) but today it looks like spring, at last:
  the sun is shining and everywhere is cherry blossoms and
  rosebuds and bees.
  
  My youngest kid and I woke up early today and went out to get
  some meat for Monday's barbecue. It is a 20 minutes walk down
  into a valley and back (with a pit stop at the fountain to
  drink some chilly mountain water) and we enjoyed every minute
  of it. I love hiking with both of them, because our attention
  is all on the things we see around us and there's plenty of 
  time for them to ask questions and me to answer them, or just
  chat about anything that comes to our minds.
  
  Once back, we went in the garden to pick up some chicory and
  water the plants. Then my eldest woke up and while the kids
  played football in the garden I went up and read a book on AI
  ethics (well, you'll probably hear more about that from me as
  this is quite a relevant part of my new job now...).
  
  Easter is tomorrow. We will be around for a few more days
  then the kids will have to get back to school, and El and I
  will fly back to London. At the thought of leaving I already
  miss them, but for now I enjoy the time we can spend together
  and our family and this cold spring.
