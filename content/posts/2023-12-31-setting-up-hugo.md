# Just setting up my Hugo

![Boromir's "one does not simply" meme with the following text: one does not simply / just set up hugo](/images/onedoesnothugo.jpg)

Aaand here's another attempt at a statically generated website.

I wanted to start with a [citation](https://twitter.com/jack/status/20) but
then I realised that (see above) there is no such thing as "just" setting 
up a (hugo, or whatever else) statically generated website... At least not
for me. Yes, I am that kind of nerd who starts with a nice idea for a post
and ends up writing their own blogging platform. And without ever completing
neither the blogging platform nor the post, of course.

This is why [Gopher](http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?a=gopher.3564020356.org)
worked great for me, as I just had to focus on content. And don't get me wrong,
I still love it. But I also think I should have some other medium to communicate
in a more expressive way - and without requiring people to have a gopher client 
installed (btw if you don't have one, go and get [Lagrange](https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange) 
NOW).

And so Hugo it is. With a barebone theme which I love (thanks 
[Vicki](https://vickiboykis.com/) and sorry this looks like a ripoff of your 
website at the moment!), and hopefully the bare minimum intervention on my side 
to make things work as I'd like. Which is like a gopherhole, basically :-), plus
an RSS feed, images when I feel the need to add them, and hopefully a light enough
publishing process that allows me to focus on contents by automatically dealing 
with different protocols. Yes, I want to play with 
[this](https://github.com/mkamarin/Hugo-2-Gopher-and-Gemini)... But I will also
build something to do the opposite and make my current gopherspace accessible 
here (in the best [sdf](http://sdf.org/) tradition, writing my own very basic
[command line tools](https://github.com/aittalam/hugo_tools)). Ultimately, 
I would like to bring my old blog posts in here too from my personal wordpress,
and consolidate all my thoughts in a single space - but even more importantly
using a single, simple, textfiles-based format.

So, what will you find here?

- first of all, the very first post I wrote on mala::notes eight (!) years
ago when I was "just setting up my Jekyll" (add your favorite facepalm meme
here): [On sharks and ice creams]({{< ref "2015-11-28-on-sharks-and-icecreams.md" >}} )
- notes from my experiments, whether they are work stuff (which I try to do
in public as much as I can) or personal pet projects such as 
[PicoGopher](https://github.com/aittalam/PicoGopher),
[Ch35t](https://github.com/aittalam/ch35t),
and my old [MoviESC](https://github.com/aittalam/moviESC)
- journal posts from my [phlog](gopher://gopher.3564020356.org), which I plan 
to continue updating: I love the format and the community, so my idea is to 
mirror them here with some time delay thus allowing gopher users to read them 
first
- finally, older stuff and material which I'd like to consolidate here

Hopefully this will work better than the previous version of mala::notes. But
well, in the worst case I'll have spent some holiday time learning about hugo
:-)
