# About me

Hi! I am Davide, son of two teachers and father of two amazing kids, reverse 
engineer by nature and machine learning engineer + researcher by job.

My main research interest is around knowledge at different levels: how
it can be formalized and collectively produced (Description Logics, 
Social Semantic Web), how it can be extracted from unstructured or 
semi-structured data (Social Web mining, ontology extraction from text),
and how it can be exploited to make sense of vast amounts of information
(machine learning, LLMs).

I currently work at Mozilla.ai where I strive to build AI systems people
are in control of. In my previous lives I was a MLE at Twitter (proudly
1.0), a lecturer and researcher at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/) and
[PoliMI](https://www.polimi.it/), one of the (few!) students of the 
[+HCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Red_Cracker), and the creator
of [3564020356](http://3564020356.org/). You can find a bit more about
me on [mala::home](http://davide.eynard.it), my (previous) website and 
blog, which will probably be moved here at some point.

Ah, I also have a [phlog](gopher://gopher.3564020356.org)!


# Why mala::notes?

mala::notes actually started few years ago, with the aim of keeping online
notes from my experiments. This did not work :-) but after almost two years
of phlogging I realised that (i) plain text / markdown is how I want to share
things, and (ii) a static website tool such as hugo might help me share them
both on Gopher and Web. This means you might see something new here or not,
depending on whether I can make my different sites converge and/or produce
new things worth sharing.
